# 📈 Cryptocurrency Investment Dashboard (AT3)

This is the **Streamlit Frontend** for the AT3 Data Product assignment. It serves as an interactive dashboard for investors to visualize historical cryptocurrency data and access Machine Learning price predictions.

## 🌟 Features
- **Multi-Asset Support:** Dedicated tabs for Solana (SOL), Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Ripple (XRP).
- **Real-Time Data:** Fetches live OHLCV (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) data directly from the **Kraken API**.
- **Interactive Charts:** Professional candlestick charts with SMA (Simple Moving Average) overlays and Volume bars using **Plotly**.
- **AI Integration:** Connects to a custom **FastAPI Backend** to display "Next-Day High" price predictions generated by an **XGBoost** model.

```

## 🚀 Setup & Installation

1. Prerequisites

	- Python 3.11+

	- The FastAPI Backend must be running (locally or on Render) for predictions to work.

2. Installation

	Navigate to the folder and install the required libraries:

```bash
cd assignment_3_streamlit
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Running the Dashboard

Launch the app using the Streamlit command:

```bash
streamlit run app/main.py
```

The app will automatically open in your browser at `http://localhost:8501`.

## ⚙️ Configuration

Connecting to the Prediction API

By default, the Solana component tries to connect to a Local API at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

To connect to a Deployed API (e.g., on Render), update the `API_URL` in `app/students/sol_25739083.py`:

```python
# app/students/sol_25739083.py

# Local Development
API_URL = "http://127.0.0.1:8000"

# Production (Uncomment and update URL)
# API_URL = "https://your-render-app-name.onrender.com"
```
